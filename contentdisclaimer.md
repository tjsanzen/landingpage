# General Content Disclaimer
## Hello viewer,

I'd like to start by thank you for choosing to watch my videos or follow my pages.
There is plenty of content on the internet, and so I am honored that you chose
to view and engage with mine. I love making videos and interacting with the aviation
community, and you are a part of making that happen. <3

#### I want to emphasize something.

My content is **ENTERTAINMENT ONLY** and under no circumstances, should you ever
mistake it for educational or life help videos. In these situations, please consult
a professional. I am not providing offical instruction, I am simply sharing what I 
love with my viewers, and sometimes I just make things up, which although is usually
satire, can be difficult to detect at times. 

#### Content on my platforms is heavily edited.

I have a background in motion graphics and visual effects. The majority of my content
has been edited in some form or another, ranging from simple color corrections, up to
giving the appearance of activities that would otherwise be dangerous, illegal, or 
impossible to attempt in reality. I make sure that I am in compliance with all local
laws and regulations, especially 14 CFR 91.13, Reckless or Careless actions. Per
the disclaimer here and on the majority of my videos, events have been edited for 
entertainment purposes, and do not include the steps that were taken to abide by
best practices, including radio calls, checklist usage, and any other safety measures.
If you have a concern with a video, please contact me immediately so that I may help
resolve it without needing to involve a third party.


#### You are the only reason I can continue doing what I love.
I hope that you will continue to support me in this amazing career.


Much love,
Tovin
